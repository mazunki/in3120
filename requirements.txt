# This repository is, for simplicity, mostly self-contained and without dependencies
# on modules that are not part of the standard Python distribution. In a select few
# cases, though, we import a few packages when the purpose is to demonstrate their
# use rather than to demonstrate how they are implemented.
#
# Do 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to have these packages installed.
